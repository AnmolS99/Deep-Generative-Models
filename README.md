# Deep Generative Models ðŸ”¢

This project was part of the Deep Learning (IT3030) course at NTNU spring 2022. The aim of this project was to create and compare two deep generative models: standard autoencoder and variational autoencoder (VAE). The models, as well as a verification neural network, were trained on the standard MNIST dataset.
